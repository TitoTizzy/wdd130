                <h2>The Academic Journey</h2>
                <p>Enrolled in Brigham Young University Idaho, one of my main goals is to complete a bachelor’s degree in software development in 3 years because I did not want to remain ignorant in the field of technology. I want to either create or be a part of the next big technological innovations in the world. Before that, I studied Business Administration at the Institut des Hautes Etudes Commerciales et Economiques from 2014 to 2018 in my home country and I spent 2 years learning Law at the Faculté de Droit et des Sciences Economiques at the Université D'Etat in Haiti.</p>

During my initial session, I have been actively engaged in various coding assignments, harnessing languages such as Python, HTML, and CSS.

My portfolio includes a growing collection of 16 completed assignments, featuring a variety of projects, including three interactive games and three calculators for tasks such as meal pricing, grade calculations, and velocity analysis. Currently, I'm immersed in an exciting project—a shopping cart program.
