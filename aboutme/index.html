        <h2>Myrtho Charles</h2>
        <p>Hello everyone, my name is Myrtho Charles and I'm from Port-au-Prince, Haiti. My major in BYUI is Software Development and I'm really excited to be here in this class.</p>
        <p>Even though I am just discovering the coding word, I was always curious about it. Now, with the few lessons I took , I am very excited to learn more and I can't wait to dive deeper into coding.</p>
        <p>I find it incredibly satisfying to create something tangible from lines of code, and the problem-solving aspect of it is just so rewarding. Looking forward to learning and collaborating with all of you in this journey! </p>
